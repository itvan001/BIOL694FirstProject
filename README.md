# BIOL694FirstProject
First Project Repo

This code was created by Isaac Van Flein from 15 Oct 2022 to 19 Oct 2022. 

The code will first create a copy of the open field test data with the 2nd 
generation removed. Then the data from all tests is systematically 
organized so that lines are arranged according to treatment groups. These 
organized data sets are then saved as their own final files. The original 
files and all the files created during the process are then placed into 
their own test-specific folders to keep things organized and consolidated.
